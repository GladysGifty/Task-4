*DESCRIPTION *: In this assignment, the goal was to build a predictive model using scikit‑learn to classify messages as ‘ham’ (legitimate) or ‘spam’ (unsolicited). The task aimed to introduce the fundamental concepts of text classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation — key elements in the field of machine learning. This assignment required leveraging the scikit‑learn library to preprocess text data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

Tools and Technologies Used
The primary tool used for this assignment was the Python programming language, an ideal choice for working with data due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and active developer community. To implement machine learning, the assignment used the following libraries and methods:

Pandas: To load and manipulate the dataset.

scikit‑learn:

train_test_split() to partition the dataset into training and testing sets.

CountVectorizer to convert text messages into a numerical feature matrix (Bag‑of‑Words).

MultinomialNB to implement a Naive Bayes classification model.

Evaluation metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix) to measure the model’s performance.

In this assignment:

The dataset was sourced from a public repository and contains examples of SMS messages classified as ham or spam.

The messages were preprocessed and converted into a structured numerical form using CountVectorizer, making the text data suitable for machine learning.

The MultinomialNB model was trained and tested, yielding an accuracy of approximately 99.19%.

A Classification Report and a Confusion Matrix were generated, providing detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1‑scores for both classes.

Real‑World Applications
Although this is a basic spam detection model, it demonstrates foundational concepts that can be implemented in many practical scenarios:

Email Services: Classifying and filtering spam emails automatically, providing a cleaner and safer experience for users.

SMS Gateways: Helping mobile operators and platforms block unwanted or fraudulent messages.

Cybersecurity: Identifying phishing or spam attacks to protect users and institutions.

Customer Support: Helping businesses triage support requests by filtering spam or irrelevant messages.
